Main Principles of Object Oriented Programming

**Encapsulation** : Building the data and methods operating on that data in one unit and hiding the values or state of the object in that unit(class)
**Abstraction** : Reduce complexity by hiding unnecessary details in classes
**Inheritance** : Its a mechanism for reusing code (common behavior) which is implemented by parent class and inherited by children
**Polymorphism** : Ability of an object to take many forms
